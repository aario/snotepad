# About SNotepad
SNotepad is a combination of modern memo apps and traditional text editors. While you enjoy the features of top modern notepad apps like multiple notes management and instant search, SNotepad doesn't save notes in a special database but instead directly on internal storage or SDCard. That means you need not to worry about backing up your valuable notes or export them every once in a while in case you changed your phone or lost it. You can also define the save path in settings dialog.
You can even give it address of your OwnCloud folder if you have the app installed. Therefor you can have all your notes backed up by OwnCloud.
