# Features
Here is a list of features found in the SNotePad application, based on the provided Javascript files:

## Markdown Editor

Provides a rich text editing experience using the EasyMDE library, allowing users to format notes with Markdown syntax for headings, lists, bold, italics, links, code blocks, quotes, and more.

## Direct File Storage

Notes are saved directly as individual files (likely `.md` or plain text) onto the user's phone storage, giving full control over the files for backup, sharing, or use with other applications.

## Folder Organization

Users can add multiple folders from their device storage to organize notes within the app. The sidebar displays these added folders for quick navigation.

## File Listing & Sorting

Within a selected folder, the app displays a list of note files, showing the filename and modification date. Users can sort this list by filename (A-Z or Z-A) or by date (newest or oldest first).

## File Search (Folder View)

A search bar allows users to quickly find notes within the currently viewed folder. The search likely includes filenames and file content, utilizing fuzzy search (Fuse.js) for flexible matching.

## Text Search (Editor View)

While editing a note, users can search for specific text within that note. Matches are highlighted.

## File Creation, Saving & Renaming

Users can create new notes within a chosen folder. Changes can be saved, and both new and existing files can be named or renamed via the editor's filename input field.

## File Deletion

Notes can be permanently deleted from the device storage directly through the folder view interface, with a confirmation step.

## Theme Customization

The application supports Light, Dark, and Auto (system preference) themes for user interface customization.

## Responsive Sidebar

A sidebar displays the user-added folders for navigation. It can be toggled on smaller screens.

## Image Handling

Supports inserting images into notes. Includes functionality for uploading images (likely via drag/drop or paste, interacting with the Android backend) and potentially handling image previews within the editor.

## Editor Toolbar

A toolbar provides quick access buttons for common Markdown formatting actions like bold, italic, headings, lists, quotes, code blocks, links, images, tables, horizontal rules, and undo/redo.

## Preview Mode

Users can toggle a preview mode to see how their Markdown notes will be rendered as formatted text.

## Side-by-Side View

Offers a split-screen view showing the Markdown source code alongside its live preview.

## Fullscreen Mode

Allows toggling a distraction-free fullscreen mode for either the editor or the preview.

## Clean Block Formatting

A toolbar action is available to remove Markdown formatting from a selected block of text.

## User Feedback & Controls

Provides user feedback through toasts for actions like saving or errors and uses confirmation modals for destructive actions like deleting files. Loading indicators inform the user during operations. Includes back-button navigation history management.

## Android Integration

The web frontend communicates with a native Android layer (`AndroidInterface`) to perform file system operations, manage preferences, and potentially handle other device interactions.

# Development

User interface part of this app is done via html5 and javascript.
Heavy usage of jquery, bootstrap 5 and SB Admin 2

## Web Assets

Web Asset source files are in html folder. After you compiled them, they get copied over to:
```
../app/src/main/assets
```
To faster develop and test the web asset files locally, open ../app/src/main/assets/index.html file in a browser wiht `?debug=true`.

### Compile

To compile web assets, run `build-assets.sh` It will compile them inside a docker container. To build the docker container refer to Build the Compile Container Section
