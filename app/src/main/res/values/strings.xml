                SNotepad is simple yet professional notepad app for android. The S
                stands for Suckless/Simple.&lt;br/&gt;
                While you enjoy the features of top modern notepad apps like multiple notes management
                and search, SNotepad doesn\'t save notes in a special database but instead directly on
                internal storage or SDCard. That means you need not to worry about backing up your
                valuable notes or export them every once in a while in case you changed your phone
                or lost it. You can also define the save path in settings dialog. You can even give
                it address of your owncloud folder if you have OwnCloud app installed. Therefor you
                can have all your notes backed up by OwnCloud.&lt;br/&gt;
                &lt;br/&gt;
                SNotepad is open source. It takes a lot of time and effort to write a software.
